The text C-k is read as `Control-K' and describes the character produced when the Control key is depressed and the k key is struck.

The text M-k is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character produced when the meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the k key is struck. If you do not have a meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing ESC first, and then typing k. Either process is known as metafying the k key.

The text M-C-k is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the character produced by metafying C-k.

[ The Option key (labeled Alt on keyboards in some countries) is sort of a “miscellaneous” key. It's the equivalent of the Alt key in Windows. ]


C-b
    Move back one character.
C-f
    Move forward one character.
DEL
    Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
C-d
    Delete the character underneath the cursor.
Printing characters
    Insert the character into the line at the cursor.
C-_
    Undo the last thing that you did. You can undo all the way back to an empty line.

C-a
    Move to the start of the line. 
C-e
    Move to the end of the line. 
M-f
    Move forward a word. 
M-b
    Move backward a word. 
C-l
    Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.


C-k
    Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

M-d
    Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.

M-DEL
    Kill from the cursor the start of the previous word, or if between words, to the start of the previous word.

C-w
    Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace. This is different than M-DEL because the word boundaries differ.

And, here is how to yank the text back into the line. Yanking means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

C-y
    Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.

M-y
    Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top. You can only do this if the prior command is C-y or M-y.
